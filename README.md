- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @alketola
- You can call me Andy (it's quite close to my real name...)
- ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in software development, SW project management, which I even have done professionally. Software based business too.
- I keep learning new things all the time. Just picked Python.
- Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on C/C++, Kotlin based stuff, or to manage a project. 
I actually started to like Python very much, it's quick for finding solutions, though not the fastest in execution.
- ðŸ“« How to reach me? Here, or by my Gmail.
